# London-1888

Project
London, 1888. England is the light of Europe, an example to follow. And social inequality at its finest…
The district of Whitechapel is the home for the poor, the face of London that is not supposed to be seen. But someone will show the world what kind of misery lives in there, in a very brutal way.

Jack the Ripper.

The very first famous serial killer in history. He will never be arrested. He will not even be identified…

For this project, you will try to help Scotland Yard to identify Jack the Ripper once and for all (spoiler: we won’t be able to…)
